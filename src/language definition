ObjectiveBrainfuck class structure:

§ // begin class
¦ //begin method 0
?{0} // new Object of Type 0;
+[-[<<[+[--->]-[<<<]]]>>>-]>-.---.>..>.<<<<-.<+.>>>>>.>.<<.<-. // regular brainfuck code (Hello World) every brainfuck command is valid
&{0}{0} //call method 0 of object 0  and save result (variable 0) in current location

/0\ // call method 0 of the current class

{1}{0}(0|1|3)  // method 0 of object 1 gets called and the values of variables 0. 1. and 3. will be passed.

@ // reset pointer to zero
$ //reset variables on tape

¦ //end method 0



¦ // begin method 1
...
¦ // end method 1

§ // end class
